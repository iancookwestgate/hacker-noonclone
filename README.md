# Hacker Noon Website Clone

#### By **Ian Cook Westgate**

## Description

This copy of Hacker Noon is an app designed for Epicodus to practice cloning a website using the Angular framework. The links have no functionality, but the final version will include connections to a Firebase database in the back-end.

## Setup

* Install Node.js.
* Clone the repo: https://github.com/iwestgate931/hacker-noonclone.git.
* Navigate to the folder in the terminal by typing in: "cd freelance-wizard".
* `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. This will open a window in your web browser with which to view the project. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
* `npm run lint` to explicitly run ESLint.

## Site Features

* Navbar recreates the neon green appearance of Hacker Noon.
* Icons and imagery are in place, retrieved directly from Hacker Noon.
* Site is loosely structured to resemble Hacker Noon's presentation.

## Planned Features

* Tighten up the arrangement of posts to better match that of Hacker Noon's.
* Bring in post information from a Firebase database.
* Spend time with CSS to properly format fonts, links, and post info.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
  * SASS
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Babel
* Webpack
* ESLint
* Firebase

## Known Bugs

* Some CSS elements are not finished and media queries have not yet been added. Consequently, the current version of this website is best viewed in fullscreen.
